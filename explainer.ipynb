    "# Motivation\n",
    "\n",
    "The music industry is a industry made up not only by the artists who perform, but also a huge network of collaborators who contribute to their work, the songwriters and producers. Award ceremonies like the Grammys represent key milestones in artistsâ€™ careers and offer a natural starting point for exploring deeper patterns of collaboration and influence within the industry.\n",
    "is shaped not only by the artists who perform but also by the vast networks of collaborators who contribute to their workâ€”particularly songwriters and producers. \n",
    "\n",
    "In this project, we focus on the top Grammy categories: Album of the Year, Record of the Year, Song of the Year, and Best New Artist, because these categories are genre-agnostic and represent the most culturally significant and commercially visible names in music. By starting with these nominees, we aim to construct two graphs, one to explore the writers, where the nodes are writers, and an edge represents two writers who have both worked on the same artist's discography, the other graph will explore the artists, where nodes are artists, and an edge represents two artists who have worked with the same writer. We will explore how the trends in data evolves and changes over decades, so we make a different graph for each decade. Our goal is to uncover how closely connected the top tier of the music world really is."

    "# Basic Stats\n",

Doing this we gathered some key datasets:\n",
    "- artist dataset, containing information about each artist\n",
    "- songs dataset, where each entry is a song, with an id and also the corresponding artist's id. Each entry also have some general information like the release year and the duration.\n",
