        <div className="prose prose-invert max-w-none">
          <p className="text-gray-300">
            The music industry is shaped not only by the artists who perform but also by the vast 
            networks of collaborators who contribute to their workâ€”particularly songwriters and producers.
          </p>
          <p className="text-gray-300">
            In this project, we focus on the top Grammy categories: Album of the Year, Record of the Year, 
            Song of the Year, and Best New Artist, because these categories are genre-agnostic and represent 
            the most culturally significant and commercially visible names in music.
          </p>
          <p className="text-gray-300">
            By starting with these nominees, we've constructed two graphs, one to explore the writers, 
            where the nodes are writers, and an edge represents two writers who have both worked on the 
            same artist's discography, the other graph will explore the artists, where nodes are artists, 
            and an edge represents two artists who have worked with the same writer.

            <p className="text-gray-300">
              Grammy nominations were collected across 50+ years of history, focusing on the top four 
              categories. Songwriter and producer credits were gathered from official music databases.

            <p className="text-gray-300">
              Two networks were built: one connecting writers who share artist collaborations, 
              and another connecting artists who share writers. Each decade is analyzed separately.

            <p className="text-gray-300">
              The networks have become increasingly dense over time, with modern music showing 
              more collaborative patterns than previous decades.

              Certain songwriters emerge as super-connectors, working with a disproportionate 
              number of Grammy-nominated artists across different genres.
